**_What is STL?_**

- A library of powerful, reusable, adaptable, generic classes and functions.
- Implemented using C++ templates.
- Impletements common data structures and algorithms.
- known time and size complexity.
- fast and type safe

**_Elements of the STL_**

1. **Containers:**
   Collections of objects or primitive types.
   [ Array, Vector, deque, stack ,set, map etc..]
2. **Algorithms: (60)**
   Functions for processing sequences of elements from containers.
   [ find,max, count, accumulate,sort etc ..]
3. **Iterators**:
   Generate sequences of element from containers.
   [ forward, reverse, by value, by reference, constant etc.]
